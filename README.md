<!-- /TOC -->
Yon is a *Survival Mode* Minecraft Realm created and owned by Damian Cugley (of Oxford) and extensively built in by him and friends over several years. You can see the terrain and biomes, here:

* http://mineatlas.com/?levelName=4966500929223253659&seed=4966500929223253659

## History

Damian and Ben built most of the original world and named some of the villages.

Various other players are involved:

* `j4` (Janet)
* `jeremy` (Jeremy)
* `olwy` (Oliver)
* `korvathefox` (Damian's brother)
* `MrTrousers` (Ben, a friend of Damian's and creator of mineatlas.com)

For a period of about a year Damian, Oliver, Janet, and Jeremy used to meet to build, for one Minecrafternoon a month.

Recently some more lovely people have joined:

* `louis_mallow` (Marsh)
* `doooooooop` (Jon aka doop)
* `dougclow` (Doug)
* `julietk15` (Juliet)
* `lucyclare` (Lucy)

## Etiquette

* Keep it PG. There are occasional teen visitors.
* No griefing (hassling other players or destroying their stuff)
* Buildings are not closed off, so if you need a bed just find one and use it
* Stuff in chests should be assumed owned and untouchable, unless marked otherwise
** An exception is if you borrow something and return it _very soon_ in the _same condition_
* Leave all doors/gates as you find them (close them behind you)

## Landmarks

There are several villages of different styles or themes. Feel free to help expand them, in keeping with taste and maintaining perimiter security. Most players have also built a house somewhere in the world, for fun and to keep their stuff. Feel free to do the same.

The above ground railway was built by `MrTrousers`. Although the original villages were close together, Oliver later built a network of https://minecraft.gamepedia.com/Nether_portal[Nether Portal]s and railways to make it easier to get around. Go into a Nether Gate and you will find signs and Gates to jump to other locations. The central nether nexus area is mostly glassed-in and covered with carpet to prevent mobs spawning, so is relatively safe. An automated switching minecart system, by MrTrousers, is partially complete. There is a Public Smeltery, built by MrTrousers, and next to that a set of chests which includes one with communal items (currently sponge and a beacon)- feel free to use these, but return them after you're done.

There's also an elevated Savannah Plateau Pedestrian Expressway in the overworld, built by Marsh, which goes all the way from Juliet's Cliffside House, past Marsh's smiley base and Yondinium, to Squaresville. It is illuminated and has a colour-changing beacon roughly half-way along.

### Villages (approximately oldest to newest)

* Squaresville
* Yondinium
* Spwantown
* Deadsville (near Rainbow Castle portals)
* Roundwell (built by Damian, go round the back of the Deadsville portal)

### People's Bases

Most people's bases are most easily located via the Nether Portal network. (Doug's are labelled 'Rainbow Castle' and are not hard to miss from the carpet.) At the moment, the exceptions are:

* Juliet: Cliffside House, about 380 ~ 160, nearest stop Marsh P's then follow cobble path or the river to the NE
* doop: about 250 ~ 730, nearest stop Squaresville, entrance under treehouse to SW of Squaresville

### Other Notable Locations

These are accessible via a portal in the Nether nexus, many via minecart tracks:

* Stronghold - Now the Enderdragon is dead you can return from The End safely. There is an ice railway (use a boat for high speed travel) all the way from the central island to an outer island, built by MrTrouser's flying machine. DO NOT BREAK THE ICE BLOCKS. This will cause the entire ice railway to collapse in to water.
* Obsidian Mine
* Jungle North of Spawn
* Mesa and Ice Biomes, a long way NE of spawn
* Nova Bioma: Taiga and Jungle

### Practically Useful Locations

#### Farms

* XP / Gold Farm (high above nether roof, take the gold minecart from the central rail system)
* Iron Farm (leave nexus by steps in NE corner past the Obsidian Mine, through the red arch, first portal)
* Blaze Farm (keep going on path after Iron Farm)
* Wither Skeleton Farm (keep going in to fortress after Blaze Farm)
* Guardian Farm (keep going on path past the Blaze Farm fortress to the far portal)
* Slime and Bone Farm (SW corner of nether nexus, go through tunnel next to Janet's Not-mushroom House, take the minecart railway, go round the Frozen Wastes/Ice Plains portal and down the twisty passageway)
* Skeleton Farm (made by Marsh, forgotten where it is other than jungle)
* Overworld mob farm (in Spawntown, go up ladder surrounded by slime blocks)

There is also an easy Wither-killing station in the nether. Take the netherbrick staircase in the east wall of the nexus and go straight on at the top, through the torchlit passage.

#### Enchantments
* 'Bookshop', sells enchantments, only open during daytime. In Squaresville at end of overworld railway.
* Marsh's Undercroft of The Secret Smiley (downstairs from his base): many Villager trades, including Mending (!!), Fortune II, Looting II, Frostwalker I, Infinity, Unbreaking II, Respiration II, Aqua Affinity
* Villager: Silk Touch - 13 emeralds, in main level 0 corridor of Rainbow Castle between North West and Central Towers
* Villager: Looting III - 43 emeralds + book, on roof above the nether (jump of XP Farm cart just after going through nether roof)

When trading with villagers for enchantments, if you take the last one and the trade locks, please unlock it again (by making enough other trades with the villager).

#### Maps

There are display maps in various places:

* Above the Public Smeltery in the nether
* Marsh's Smiley base, on wall outside south door
* Doug's Rainbow Castle, North West Tower level 1 (nearest main entrance)
* Somewhere Korvar made a massive overworld map of his epic railway
* The End, in middle of central island, near exit portal and ladder to ice boat railway

### Heraldry

Several players have adopted a banner (or two) to signify their constructions, portals, and so on. There is a display of all of them to the left of the Public Smeltery.

* Brown with white central strip and black chief indented - MrTrousers
* Black with red fess, black with purple fess - Marsh
* Rainbow - Doug
* Blue with yellow flower charge
* Blue with white diagonal cross (Scottish saltire)
* White with red roundel and black bordure
