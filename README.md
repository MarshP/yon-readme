## About Yon and This Readme

Our MC realm has a **[wiki of useful stuff for new and returning players](https://github.com/MarshP/yon-readme/wiki)**. Send Marsh you github name to start editing.

Yon is a *Survival Mode* Minecraft Realm created and owned by DnC (of Oxford) and extensively built by him and friends over several years. You can see the terrain and biomes [on MineAtlas](http://mineatlas.com/?levelName=4966500929223253659&seed=4966500929223253659).

The more thorough Yon Gist is [maintained by OG](https://gist.github.com/ollyg/78e7bf8d3df70f7bb0727493dcb9ceaf#file-yon-realm-asciidoc). It has sections on history, heraldry and more. This readme is a reference of only **practically useful** stuff for new or returning players. There may be versions of this readme in other formats, such as asciidoc and pdf, in the same directory as this file.

*Note:* This repo is public and so names are obfuscated - see the gist.
