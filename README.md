## About Yon and This Readme

Yon is a *Survival Mode* Minecraft Realm created and owned by DnC (of Oxford) and extensively built by him and friends over several years. You can see the terrain and biomes [on MineAtlas](http://mineatlas.com/?levelName=4966500929223253659&seed=4966500929223253659).

The more thorough Yon Gist is [maintained by OG](https://gist.github.com/ollyg/78e7bf8d3df70f7bb0727493dcb9ceaf#file-yon-realm-asciidoc).  This readme is a reference of practically useful stuff for new or returning players.

**Note:** This readme is public and names are obfuscated - see the gist.

## Useful Locations

### Player Bases

Players can be found near their main bases a lot of the time, as this is also where their trades and food farms are likely to be. These are also good places to leave trade goods, notes (as signs or written books), borrow items, etc.

|Player|Approx. Coordinates|Description|Overworld Directions|Notes, Features|
|:--:|:--:|:-------------|:----------|:---|
|Cleanskies|235, 604|Cleanskies' first house; a ranch house with flowers on the roof.|Follow the [Gravel Path](#Transport) west out of Squaresville. The house is north of the path.|Beautiful glasshouses and a riot of flowers, set into ranch-like grounds with architectural sculptures.|
|dp|250, 730<br>(underground)|dp's vaulted underground base. (Moria?)|Entrance under [Treehouse](#Landmarks) to SW of Squaresville|Amazing hand-dug vaults with pillars worth the visit, plus some quacking surprises.|
|DgC|800, 510|The Rainbow Castle|Follow the [Gravel Path](#Transport) east from Squaresville, under the [SPPE](#Transport) and beyond.|Set up as a proper visitor attraction with amazing megabuilds, diving boards, canals and more... Spend the day.|
|DnC|255, 300|The acacia and cobble octagon.|Take either cobbled path east from Spawntown, or noth from Yondinium. The house is at the northernmost tip of Yondinium, just south of the river, a stone's throw from the 0,0 desert.|An oddly convoluted build, typical of DnC. The updtairs is one of the realm's only attempts at realistic furnishings. This house is less of a main base than others listed here, as DnC builds all over the realm as fancy takes him.|
|JK|380, 160|JK's cliffside house.|Take the [Savannah Plateau Pedestrian Expressway (SPPE) or River](#Transport) to Marsh's then follow the river NE, or take the SPPE to the end and descend from JK's tower above the house.|A large but organic build in harmony with its environment. Best viewed from the desert to the NNW to see how the house shapes to the drop from the Savannah Plateau.|
|JMcK|-200, 430|JMcK's waterfall house.| No clear overworld path. Best is to start at OG's house, then travel WNW through the birch forest. The tall red and white striped pylon will guide you to the mountain house, nearby. If you reach that, go back east a little.|The waterfall house is the most picturesque of several of JMcK's houses. There's shaped, routed waterfalls, a turf bridge between peaks, and several stairways into the mountains.|
|Korvar|107, 247|Korvar's glass-toppped box.|The nearest house to spawn, in the middle of Spawntown.|Now somewhat overshadowed by Korvar's [monstrous pagoda](#Landmarks), this house has a cellar of surprises for smelting, brewing, a giant [slime farm](#Mob-and-Resource-Farms) and deep tunnels to MrTrousers' base.|
|LK|todo|todo|todo|todo|
|MAMP|332, 189|Smiley Face|Take the offshoot near the N end of the SPPE, or follow paths and rivers E from Spawntown, NE from Yondinium|The themed roof is best seen from above on the [SPPE](#Transport) or Yondinium buildings. The house itself is sorta iron-age fort. In contrast to nearby JK's house, the grounds are an example of extensive terraforming/bulldozing. The sword used to kill the first Ender Dragon is framed here.|
|MrTrousers|50, 370<br>(built into the cliff)|Lair de Trousers|Hop off the [Overland Railway](#Transport) at the huge wheat farm, or follow deep tunnels from Korvar's Spawntown house. Follow directions on the sign to use the entrance elevator. Above ground, there is a hole for entry by elytra.|It's a palace of wonders, with some of Yon's most advanced RS contraptions and farms. Explore, trying to work out how various thing work: Why do the pumpkins float past? Where are the mobs rising from? _How much sugar cane?_ How are the villagers bred? There is also a [secret villager trading area](#Mob-and-Resource-Farms) and a [spider spawner](#Mob-and-Resource-Farms).|
|OG|109,606|OG's swamp-edge house.|Follow the [Gravel Path](#Transport) to its western end.|The house is within easy step of the nearby swamp. OG keeps a set of animals - cows and colourful sheep - in water rather than fenes, for reasons unknown. The house straddles a large lava pond with a glass floor - beware gaps! An attractive bridge links OG's mountain house. To the south is a chain of hotels that can be used when travelling in that direction in the overworld.|

### Transport

#### Overworld transport

The **Overworld Railway** built by MrTrousers runs from the western edge of Spawntown to the heart of Squaresville, right by the [bookshop](#Landmarks). It's a fun ride with automated cart service and collection. Though largely safe, sections are unlit and unglassed, so use the train at night only if properly equipped. If you set off a creeper, remember to effect repairs!

The **Savannah Plateau Pedestrian Expressway (SPPE)** built by MAMP is useful if you want to travel north-south, but are east of the Yondinium-Squaresville line, making it irksome to get to the railway which is far to the west. The SPPE has a (colour-shifting) beacon to speed foot passage, and literal jumping-off points to get to Yondinium and the Gravel Path, by falling into water or elytra flight.

> There is a concealed path just east of the SPPE, running parallel to it. This is useful to join the SPPE from ground level without travelllng to either end first.

> Half way along the SPPE, next to the beacon, there is a nether portal.

The **Gravel Path** is _mainly_ made of gravel and runs east-west all the way from the Rainbow Castle, under the SPPE, through Squaresville near the bookshop, to the swamp near OG's house. This is an underrated method of transport right through our central realm, ripe for improvement and protection.

[**Ender pearls**](#Communal-and-Borrowable-Items) speed up overworld travel considerably. 

#### Nether transport

The nether hub is a large area carpeted with a map of the overworld. Portals are mainly within sight of each other and well signed.

An **automated railway station** is under construction by MrTrousers; signs indicate which lines are functioning so far.

**Paths out of the nether hub** at the NW and SW, SE corners lead to:
* NW path to nether fortress with [blaze spawner](#Mob-and-Resource-Farms) and [wither skeleton farm](#Mob-and-Resource-Farms), also to the [iron farm](#Mob-and-Resource-Farms) built by Korvar, and the [guardian farm](#Mob-and-Resource-Farms) for sea lanterns and prismarine.
* SW path to various out-of-the-way housing, and also the [BIG slime farm](#Mob-and-Resource-Farms) and [skeleton farm (B)](#Mob-and-Resource-Farms) built by MAMP (a train goes part way).
* SE to the Rainbow Castle and the [End Portal Stronghold](#Landmarks)
* North end of the hub is a portal leading into the 0,0 desert, where the [squid ink farm](#Mob-and-Resource-Farms) is located.
**Railways out of the nether hub**, not counting little internal railways over walking distances:
* NE corner - Railway to Mesa and Ice Biomes by JK. This way for coloured clay!
* E edge GIANT railway to the [Woodland Mansion]. This is entirely glassed and paved, and is probably the realm's biggest single build, made by Korvar.
* Straight up - through the nether roof to the [XP and gold farm](#Mob-and-Resource-Farms)
  * A foot stairway ascend from the east of the hub to meet this train at the nether roof. This is also the route to the [Wither-killing space](#Mob-and-Resource-Farms)
* North and down - to the jungle biomes and [skeleton farm (A)](#Mob-and-Resource-Farms)
* South and down - to Nova Bioma, with jungle and taiga biomes.

## Old Material being reworked ##

**Landmarks**


There are several villages of different styles or themes. Feel free to help expand them, in keeping with taste and maintaining perimiter security. Most players have also built a house somewhere in the world, for fun and to keep their stuff. Feel free to do the same.

The above ground railway was built by `MrTrousers`. Although the original villages were close together, Oliver later built a network of https://minecraft.gamepedia.com/Nether_portal[Nether Portal]s and railways to make it easier to get around. Go into a Nether Gate and you will find signs and Gates to jump to other locations. The central nether nexus area is mostly glassed-in and covered with carpet to prevent mobs spawning, so is relatively safe. An automated switching minecart system, by MrTrousers, is partially complete. There is a Public Smeltery, built by MrTrousers, and next to that a set of chests which includes one with communal items (currently sponge and a beacon)- feel free to use these, but return them after you're done.

There's also an elevated Savannah Plateau Pedestrian Expressway in the overworld, built by Marsh, which goes all the way from JK's Cliffside House, past Marsh's smiley base and Yondinium, to Squaresville. It is illuminated and has a colour-changing beacon roughly half-way along.

**Villages (approximately oldest to newest)**

* Squaresville
* Yondinium
* Spwantown
* Deadsville (near Rainbow Castle portals)
* Roundwell (built by DnC, go round the back of the Deadsville portal)

**People's Bases**

Most people's bases are most easily located via the Nether Portal network. (DgC's are labelled 'Rainbow Castle' and are not hard to miss from the carpet.) At the moment, the exceptions are:

* JK: Cliffside House, about 380 ~ 160, nearest stop Marsh P's then follow cobble path or the river to the NE
* dp: about 250 ~ 730, nearest stop Squaresville, entrance under treehouse to SW of Squaresville

**### Other Notable Locations**

These are accessible via a portal in the Nether nexus, many via minecart tracks:

* Stronghold - Now the Enderdragon is dead you can return from The End safely. There is an ice railway (use a boat for high speed travel) all the way from the central island to an outer island, built by MrTrouser's flying machine. DO NOT BREAK THE ICE BLOCKS. This will cause the entire ice railway to collapse in to water.
* Obsidian Mine
* Jungle north of Spawn
* Mesa and Ice Biomes, a long way NE of spawn
* Nova Bioma: Taiga and Jungle

**### Practically Useful Locations**

**#### Farms**

* XP / Gold Farm (high above nether roof, take the gold minecart from the central rail system)
* Iron Farm (leave nexus by steps in NE corner past the Obsidian Mine, through the red arch, first portal)
* Blaze Farm (keep going on path after Iron Farm)
* Wither Skeleton Farm (keep going in to fortress after Blaze Farm)
* Guardian Farm (keep going on path past the Blaze Farm fortress to the far portal)
* Slime and Bone Farm (SW corner of nether nexus, go through tunnel next to JMcK's Not-mushroom House, take the minecart railway, go round the Frozen Wastes/Ice Plains portal and down the twisty passageway)
* Skeleton Farm (made by Marsh, forgotten where it is other than jungle)
* Overworld mob farm (in Spawntown, go up ladder surrounded by slime blocks)

There is also an easy Wither-killing station in the nether. Take the netherbrick staircase in the east wall of the nexus and go straight on at the top, through the torchlit passage.

**#### Enchantments**
* 'Bookshop', sells enchantments, only open during daytime. In Squaresville at end of overworld railway.
* Marsh's Undercroft of The Secret Smiley (downstairs from his base): many Villager trades, including Mending (!!), Fortune II, Looting II, Frostwalker I, Infinity, Unbreaking II, Respiration II, Aqua Affinity
* Villager: Silk Touch - 13 emeralds, in main level 0 corridor of Rainbow Castle between North West Tower and Central Tower
* Villager: Looting III - 43 emeralds + book, on roof above the nether (jump of XP Farm cart just after going through nether roof)

When trading with villagers for enchantments, if you take the last one and the trade locks, please unlock it again (by making enough other trades with the villager).

**#### Maps**

There are display maps in various places:

* Above the Public Smeltery in the nether
* Marsh's Smiley base, on wall outside south door
* DgC's Rainbow Castle, North West Tower level 1 (nearest main entrance)
* Somewhere Korvar made a massive overworld map of his epic railway
* The End, in middle of central island, near exit portal and ladder to ice boat railway

**### Heraldry**

Several players have adopted a banner (or two) to signify their constructions, portals, and so on. There is a display of all of them to the left of the Public Smeltery.

* Brown with white central strip and black chief indented - MrTrousers
* Black with red fess, black with purple fess - Marsh
* Rainbow - DgC
* Blue with yellow flower charge
* Blue with white diagonal cross (Scottish saltire)
* White with red roundel and black bordure
